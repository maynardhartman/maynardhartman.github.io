For me, the process of becomming a software developer was a slow one.  Previously, I
worked as a Unix Administrator for a large company, and in the course of my employment
I was tasked from time to time to write a script for something, or if it was real serious
something in 'C'.  So my exposure to software, structure and syntax was ingrained in my
consciousness early on.  Over the years I took on some projects that I had decided i must
do.  They involved learning many languages including 'C' 'C#' XAML, and .Net to name a few.
For one reason or another these projects fizzed leaning me with the knowlege to go on
but no real good reason to do so.  So I decided on a career change.  I no longer wanted 
to fill a role as Unix Admin because it required a high level of hardware knowledge and I 
no longer felt the calling to fill that role.  So I chose software engineering.  I got a windows 
phone and decided to learn development on that (which proved to be an excersise in futility
as Microsoft dropped their phone prior to me being close to releasing any software.  Bad 
decision #1.  I will however admit that I learned a great deal about cross development, and 
the 'C#' language.  I decided I needed a structured, what's happening now, sort of learning
investment so I went lookinng around.  Found a school named Lambda which seemed like
a fit so I enrolled there and made it 'till week five (React) where i soon crashed and burned.
So i was determined to become a software developer, I got back on the horse and started 
looking again.  This time Flatiron jumed out at me, maybe because of advertisement on facebook
I don't know.  So I decided to try their bootcamp.  Now Im not going to blame Lambda because
that would be sour grapes, but there are already things apparent with Flatiron which strikes 
me as a better way to teach.  I will post more when I know more.  Wish me luck!
