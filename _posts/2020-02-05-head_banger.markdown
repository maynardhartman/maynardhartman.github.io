Well, I wish I could say everything was aok with this project, but I did not exactly go as planed.  First off;
I decided to set up my Environment for Windows Ruby Development.  This isn't required until Sinatra, but
you know I thought I'd get a leg up.  The installation for most everything went as planned.  So, that completed
I followed instructions for setting up a Git environment.  This is where I hit my first snag!  I don't know I guess
it is my lack of understanding of Git and how it works, but I botched up my whole namespace (for the project).
I let this go for a week and then it caught up with me.  My commits were not going to my Git Repository but 
instead to my local hard disk. So I paniced, making a real mess out of things.  So I figured it's tiime for help.

Help arrived in the form of Enoch and got me pushing to Github as required.  The takeways is don't keep tryiing
to fix it youself ask for help!  So development time. I got out my trusty checklist and started reading.  OK.  It all
seemed reasonable.  But now I'm out of time, it's due at midnight.  And I just got Git working.  So being prepared 
for an alnighter I set to typing.  Seven AM, and I'm still debugging.  Not going to make it.  So I tell my lead where
and when I'll be finished.  This was a daydream as it turns out.  I asked my lead to help me out with a problem 
I was having, and he discovered that I had drifted of course, and left OOP behind.  I'm used to functiona programming
(a time where previous knowlege can hurt you).  So he gave me the bad news about my code and another 
extension.   So i got to work again.  My api, that i was pushing my requests against suddenly decided to
stop giving me access.  I received the dreaded "Not Authorizied" error, and said Hrmmm.  Then I paniced again.
What if i can't get it going agian?  My whole project is null and void.  Then things started spinning out of 
control.  I had to refactor the whole thing this time using another API!  Then a couple of days later my old API
began accepting connections again.   Go figure.  So back to the drawing board.  Determined to do it the 
right way, and impress my reviewers.  So here I sit still working on CLI project, and very behind in my studies.
So it's panic time again.  I feel like I'm sinking, and not understandingn why?  But, hey, you've got this I've no
doubt.  So good luck.
