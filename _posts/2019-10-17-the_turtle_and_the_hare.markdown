Just to we can esablish who is the turtle and who is ther hare from the fable above, I in this case am the 
turtle, and everyone else seems to be the hare.  I got behind in the first week because of time issues 
that I was having outsider of Flatiron which interfered with my normal learning scchedule.  This put me 
behind about 1 week, Lesson learned.  Stick to the schedule.  Now Ive managed to play catchup but
it was hard and I am barely cought up.  Still needing to finsih some labs this weekend I hope.  There are
several problems associated with beind first, you almost are forced to go it alone as lectures and study groups
have finished the material already and moved on.  Now this is a general statement everyone at Flatiron is great
esp., the individual students with helping but in all fairness its hard to ask someone to help you catchup
when you know they are faced with their own challenges, yet some helped get through some rather tough
labs.  i'd like to give a shout out to two of them.  Alyssa Yates, and Bryant Richards.  These two really went above and beyond in helping me.  They each had their own projects to fullfil yet found time to nursemaid me through my own. Ii owe alot to these two. Still the turtle is behind.  i also learned that i need to go it alone with the labs because of missed opportunities with study groups.  There are many more examples but you get the idea.  the biggest loss
though is interaction with my fellow cohort mates. Its lonely behind.  if you find yourseld falling behind my advice to you is catch as quickly as you can, and use help.  Put in extra time if necessarey, or be prepared to go it alone.
