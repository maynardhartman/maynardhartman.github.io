I don't honestly know the answer to this question.  I supposed I could say that: Like in life we group all things into
objects or into containers if you will.  An example, Animals are grouped and like in OO we can add a new group 
should we discover a new species of animal, with the new keyword.  Or we could add a dog to our animal group
very easily since since it is already included under animals, simply with Dog.new(name).  Everything in life is organized
into groups by us humans, and  OO minics this behaviour which are known in computer parlance as Objects. My dog
is an Object, that belongs to animals  species canine sub species labrador object Buddy.
